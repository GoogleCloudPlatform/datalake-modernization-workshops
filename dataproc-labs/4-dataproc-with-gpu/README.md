# Dataproc and Nvidia - Better Together

This lab showcases Apache Spark application acceleration with spark-rapids on Dataproc on GCE & Dataproc Serverless Spark - powered by Nvidia GPUs. The lab is an adaptation of the lab from Nvidia in the Google Cloud Platform Data Lake Modernization repo that has been simplified to provide a quickstart experience with the addition of Terraform for automation.
